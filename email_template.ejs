  <p>Hi <%= firstName %>,</p>

  <p>
    I hope this email finds you well. I'll be learning to code JavaScript full-time at 
    Fullstack Academy starting next week and I've been enjoying my time in their online 
    prerequisite classes so far. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make 
    in their foundations class.

    I've been blogging about my programming experiences on my new Tumblr blog. 
    Here are my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>><%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>  
  <p>
    Best regards,<br>
    DJ
